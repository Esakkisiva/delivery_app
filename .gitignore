# --- Environment Variables ---
# This is the most important rule. Never commit your secrets,
# API keys, or database URLs to version control.
.env


# --- Virtual Environment ---
# The virtual environment folder contains all installed packages and can be huge.
# It should be recreated by anyone using the project via the requirements.txt file.
/venv/
/.venv/


# --- Python Cache and Compiled Files ---
# These files are generated by Python automatically to speed up your code.
# They don't need to be in version control as they are regenerated as needed.
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd


# --- IDE and Tool Configuration (Optional but good practice) ---
# These folders are created by code editors and tools like DBeaver.
# They are specific to your local machine setup.
